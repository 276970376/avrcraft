THIS SUBPROJECT IS AWFUL.

DO NOT USE IT FOR ANYTHING.

IT IS NOT INTENDED AS A LEGITIMATE SOLUTION AND CRASHES ALL THE TIME.

There's a reason I called my modded TCP stack "tcp_awful."  It actually drops packets!

But, I did it, I shoehorned a full Minecraft server down to under 1k RAM, using a USB RNDIS Ethernet driver from LUFA.

IP is 192.168.55.243:25565... It totally works.

(Minecraft 1.8)

Boy it would be nice to know what's causing most of these errors!!
